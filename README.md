## Data Sources: 

In main.py, I use CSV reader to import three unrelated data files from Kaggle.com. 

I created a table called covid_cases that reports the aggregate number of cases and deaths for each county in the US each day. 

The table politics stores data on the votes by county for each political candidate in the 2016 and 2012 elections. 

The table demographics tracks information like gender breakdown, population, and median age for each US county. 

I cleaned the data in this file as well, adding unique county identifier codes called fips to entries that were missing the code so that I could tie the data together.

## Thesis 1: The political party associated with a county is strongly correlated with the extent of the COVID outbreak in that county. 

In politics.py, I explored my first theory: There is a correlation between a county's political affiliation and the extent to which it is devastated by COVID-19. I found a strong correlation amongst Democratic counties and counties with high instances of COVID. After digging into this further, I noticed that these Democratic counties had very large populations and that Republican counties tended to be less dense.

I wanted to see if there were any changes to this trend as time went on, specifically as the country began to reopen. I noticed that the gap between Democratic and Republican counties' new cases was narrowing starting right around Memorial Day Weekend, likely in connection with reopenings and the ease of restrictions. Republican new cases even surpassed Democratic new cases in September. Furthermore, Republican deaths are on the rise, as Democratic and swing states begin to flatten.

## Thesis 2: The extent to which COVID has impacted swing states will impact the way they vote in the upcoming presidential election.

In voter_participation.py, I identified which states, based on the 2016 presidential election, were swing states. 

I then wanted to see how these states were performing amidst the pandemic. Overall, swing states have lower cases for population size. However, I noticed an uptick in cases (accounting for population size) in many swing states, particularly Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. My hypothesis is that health issues will be at the forefront this year and is likely to persuade voters in these states to vote for a Democratic candidate.

### Smaller Data Explorations:

In demographics.py, I mapped out the trends with COVID cases in relation to population, age, and percentage of the population that was female, finding the highest correlation with population unsurprisingly. 

I also explored the theory that the date of the first case impacted the magnitude of the pandemic in a particular county, with counties who had their first case earlier being more likely to experience a heightened breakout.

In stockgraph.py, I analyzed the correlation between the stock market and the number of new COVID cases. There was a looser correlation than initially predicted.

In mortality.py, I calculated the average and total mortality rates across the country and examined to see if there were any outliers. The counties with the highest mortality rates (greater than 15%) had fewer than 500 total cases, and were the counties with comparatively low populations (22,000 average population compared to nationwide average of 101,000). 

I then looked at counties with high mortality rates and high cases per population, and found Georgia had 6 of these outliers and Texas had 4. Overall, however, the outliers with high cases and mortality rates were a mix of Democratic and Republican counties.

In outliers.py, I investigated the possibility that some counties had higher populations but lower cases, but unfortunately only found one outlier: New York, which had a high number of cases and deaths, even for its population.
